## How to start

You can download the theme manually by going to
[butlerx/hugo-theme-base16](https://github.com/butlerx/hugo-theme-base16) and
pasting it to `themes/terminal` in your root directory.

You can also clone it directly to your Hugo folder:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bulerx/hugo-theme-base16.git themes/base16
```

If you don't want to make any radical changes, it's the best option, because you
can get new updates when they are available. You can also include it as a git
submodule:

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/bulerx/hugo-theme-base16.git themes/base16
```

## How to configure

The theme doesn't require any advanced configuration. Just copy:

```toml
baseurl = "/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "Blog Title"
author = "Authors Name"
pygmentsCodeFences = true
theme = "base16"
paginate = 5

[outputs]
  home = ["HTML", "RSS", "JSON"]

[params]
  hero = "Base16"
  message = "Sub Title message"
  descriptions = "Blog description"
  twitter = "twitter user"
```

to `config.toml` file in your Hugo root directory and change params fields

## Enable Search

To enable search add create the `search.md` from the search archtype by running
`hugo new --kind search search.md`. Then add `JSON` to the output of `home` in
`config.toml` as

```toml

  home = ["HTML", "RSS", "JSON"]
